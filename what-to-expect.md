# What to Expect

A coderetreat is a day dedicated to practicing software design and teamwork, free from deadlines or deliverables. You’ll work in short iterations (typically 45–60 minutes), pair with different people, and reset the code between rounds. The focus is on **learning**, **exploration**, and **improvement** - not finishing a project. Expect to experiment, make mistakes, and discuss ideas openly with other participants. Each round is a fresh opportunity to try new techniques and refine your approach.
