# Pairing and Collaboration

Coderetreats are best experienced through **pair programming**. You’ll switch partners throughout the day, which helps you learn new perspectives and ways of thinking.

There’s no single “correct” way to pair. Each style emphasizes different dynamics of thinking, speaking, and typing. Try out a few styles throughout the day, especially ones you don’t normally use.

## Common Pair Programming Styles

### 🧭 Driver / Navigator

The most familiar style.

One person (“Driver”) types; the other (“Navigator”) guides the direction, reviews, and thinks ahead. Switch roles often - every few minutes or after a test passes to stay balanced.

**Good for:** steady rhythm, communication, and shared understanding.

### 🏓 Ping-Pong Pairing

A natural fit for TDD.

One person writes a failing test (**Red**), the other writes just enough code to make it pass (**Green**), then you switch roles for the next test.

**Good for:** keeping both partners equally engaged and reinforcing the Red-Green-Refactor rhythm.

### 💪 Strong-Style Pairing

From Llewellyn Falco: *“For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands.”*

The person with the idea explains it; their partner does the typing. This style emphasizes clear communication and shared decision-making.

**Good for:** mentoring, deep collaboration, and learning to articulate ideas clearly.

### 🔄 Remote / Distributed Pairing

When pairing remotely, use tools like VS Code Live Share or Tuple, and switch control regularly. Narrate your thoughts as you go to stay in sync.

**Good for:** distributed teams and hybrid sessions.

## Tips for Effective Pairing

  - **Agree on a style** before you start each session; try switching it up between rounds.
  - **Talk before you type.** Discuss the next step before diving in.
  - **Work in small steps.** Test, code, refactor, repeat.
  - **Stay curious.** Ask questions, try new techniques, and reflect afterward.
  - **Reset together.** After each round, clear the code and start fresh.

## Try Something New

Coderetreats are a safe space to experiment.

If you usually default to Driver/Navigator, try Ping-Pong or Strong-Style pairing for a session. You may discover new insights—not just about the problem, but about how you collaborate.
