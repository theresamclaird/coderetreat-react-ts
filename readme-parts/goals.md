## Goals of a Coderetreat

A coderetreat is about *deliberate practice* - improving the craft of software development through repetition, feedback, and collaboration. Thereâ€™s no pressure to finish or to keep your code.

The goals are:

- Write tests first and practice incremental design.
- Explore different ways to model the same problem.
- Pair with others and share perspectives.
- Reflect after each round to identify new insights.

Focus on learning, not outcomes. The value comes from the conversations, experiments, and refactoring you do along the way.
