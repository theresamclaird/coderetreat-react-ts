## Other Katas

While the **Game of Life** is a popular choice for coderetreats, you can use this project as a starting point for any problem that encourages incremental design and refactoring. Choose exercises that are small, testable, and open-ended enough to spark discussion about design choices and collaboration.

Here are a few classic examples:

- **FizzBuzz**: A simple introduction to test-driven thinking and refactoring loops and conditions.  
- **String Calculator**: Focuses on incremental test discovery and handling edge cases gracefully.  
- **Roman Numerals**: Encourages thinking about data transformations and algorithmic clarity.  
- **Bowling Game**: A slightly larger kata involving cumulative state and scoring rules.  
- **Prime Factors**: Reinforces small-step problem solving and function composition.  

Each kata presents different opportunities to explore **clean code**, **TDD**, and **pair programming** skills in a safe, time-boxed setting.
