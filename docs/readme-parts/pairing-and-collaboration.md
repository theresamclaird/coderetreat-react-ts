# Pairing and Collaboration

Coderetreats are best experienced through **pair programming**. Youâ€™ll rotate partners between sessions, which helps you see different problem-solving styles and coding habits.  

There are several ways to pair, such as *driver/navigator*, *ping-pong pairing* (test/code switch), or *strong-style pairing* (where the idea must be spoken aloud before the other types it). Feel free to experiment and see which style fits your rhythm.

A few tips:

- Talk about your approach before you start typing.  
- Take small steps and commit frequently.  
- Switch roles often to stay engaged and balanced.  
- Focus on communication over correctness; every pairing is a chance to learn.
