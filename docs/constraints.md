# Constraints

Coderetreats are about practice, not production. As the day progresses, you’ll gain confidence with the problem and start seeing familiar patterns. That’s when it’s time to add constraints - intentional limitations that challenge how you think and work.

A constraint changes *how* you code, not *what* you build. It helps you explore new techniques, habits, and ways of collaborating.

## Why Use Constraints

- **Break habits.** Constraints disrupt your default approach so you can see problems from a new angle.
- **Sharpen focus.** Each constraint emphasizes a specific practice: communication, simplicity, or test design.
- **Encourage play.** Constraints make later rounds feel fresh and creative.

## Examples of Common Constraints

### 🧍‍♀️ No Talking

All communication happens through code and tests. Encourages clarity, naming discipline, and non-verbal coordination.

### 🧠 No Conditionals

You can’t use if, else, or ternary expressions. Encourages polymorphism, data-driven logic, or lookup tables.

### 💬 Ping-Pong TDD

One partner writes a failing test, the other writes the implementation to make it pass. Encourages rhythm and shared ownership.

### 🔁 Refactor-Only Round

No new functionality—spend the whole session cleaning and improving existing code. Encourages focus on design quality.

### ⏳ Silent TDD

No implementation until you have at least three failing tests. Reinforces planning and incremental progress.

### 🖐 Five-Line Functions

No function or method can exceed five lines. Encourages decomposition and naming.

The link to Corey Haines facilitator guide below contains several interesting suggestions. One of my favorites is **Evil Coder** where a deliberately malicious driver implements code that technically makes the test pass, but may introduce as much complexity into the code as they wish or choose an obscure implementation strategy.

Explore constraints and have fun!

### Tips for Choosing Constraints

  - Choose constraints that align with what you want to explore next.
  - Introduce one new constraint per round; don’t stack too many.
  - Reflect afterward: What did we learn from the limitation?
  - Don’t worry about finishing; focus on what you discover.

## When to Incorporate Constraints

If you and your partner are experienced with coderetreats or already know the problem domain well, dive right in; constraints are an excellent way to stretch your skills and explore new approaches early in the day.

If you’re new to coderetreats, wait until the afternoon or after a few rounds before adding constraints. By then, you’ll be comfortable with the problem and might notice yourself repeating familiar patterns. That’s the perfect moment to introduce a constraint that feels a little uncomfortable. Those rounds often lead to the biggest insights.
