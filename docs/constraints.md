# Constraints

Coderetreats are about practice, not production. As the day progresses, you’ll gain confidence with the problem and start seeing familiar patterns. That’s when it’s time to add constraints - intentional limitations that challenge how you think and work.

A constraint changes *how* you code, not *what* you build. It helps you explore new techniques, habits, and ways of collaborating.

## Why Use Constraints

- **Break habits.** Constraints disrupt your default approach so you can see problems from a new angle.
- **Sharpen focus.** Each constraint emphasizes a specific practice: communication, simplicity, or test design.
- **Encourage play.** Constraints make later rounds feel fresh and creative.

## Examples of Common Constraints

### 🧍‍♀️ No Talking

All communication happens through code and tests. Encourages clarity, naming discipline, and non-verbal coordination.

### 🧠 No Conditionals

You can’t use if, else, or ternary expressions. Encourages polymorphism, data-driven logic, or lookup tables.

### 💬 Ping-Pong TDD

One partner writes a failing test, the other writes the implementation to make it pass. Encourages rhythm and shared ownership.

### 🔁 Refactor-Only Round

No new functionality—spend the whole session cleaning and improving existing code. Encourages focus on design quality.

### ⏳ Silent TDD

No implementation until you have at least three failing tests. Reinforces planning and incremental progress.

### 🖐 Five-Line Functions

No function or method can exceed five lines. Encourages decomposition and naming.

## Tips for Facilitators (or Pairs)

	- Choose constraints that align with what you want to explore next.
	- Introduce one new constraint per round—don’t stack too many.
	- Reflect afterward: What did we learn from the limitation?
	- Don’t worry about finishing—focus on what you discover.

## Try This

By the afternoon, try at least one constraint that feels uncomfortable. It’s often in those rounds that the biggest insights happen.
