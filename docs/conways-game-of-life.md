# Conway’s Game of Life

The **Game of Life**, devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970, is a zero-player cellular automaton that has become a classic programming kata.  

The game's evolution is determined entirely by its initial state — you simply set the starting configuration and observe as the system unfolds.

In coderetreats, this exercise is traditionally used to explore design, refactoring, and test-driven development. Because the rules are simple yet lead to complex emergent behavior, it challenges developers to think deeply about data structures, state transitions, and clean separation of logic.

## The Rules

Each cell in a two-dimensional grid is either *alive* or *dead*, and interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). Each generation is produced by applying these rules simultaneously to every cell in the grid, making each new state a pure function of the previous one.

In the examples below:
    `o` = live cell
    `x` = dead cell

At each `tick` these rules are applied:

1. **Underpopulation** — Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.

```
x x x      x x x
x o x  ->  x x x
x x o      x x o
```

In the first generation the middle cell is alive and has exactly one live neighbor (bottom-right). It dies in the next generation due to underpopulation.

2. **Overpopulation** — Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.

```
o x o      o x o
x o o  ->  x x o
x o x      x o x
```

The middle cell is alive and has four live neighbors. It dies in the next generation due to overpopulation.

3. **Survival** — Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.

```
o x x      o x x
x o x  ->  x o x
x x o      x x o
```

The middle cell remains alive in the next generation because it has two live neighbors.

4. **Reproduction** — Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

```
o x o      o x o
x x x  ->  x o x
x x o      x x o
```

The middle cell is dead in the first generation but becomes alive in the next due to reproduction.

## Example Pattern: The “Blinker”

A simple oscillator pattern that alternates between vertical and horizontal states every generation.

**Generation 1**

```
x o x
x o x
x o x
```

**Generation 2**

```
x x x
o o o
x x x
```

> **Tip:**  
> This kata is less about implementing a perfect simulation and more about exploring *how design evolves*.  
> Focus on writing small, testable functions that model rules clearly, refactoring as patterns emerge.
