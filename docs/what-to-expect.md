# What to Expect

A coderetreat is a day dedicated to practicing software design and teamwork, free from deadlines or deliverables. You’ll work in short iterations (typically 45 minutes), pairing with different people, and practicing the craft. The focus is on **learning**, **exploration**, and **improvement** - not finishing a project. Expect to experiment, make mistakes, and discuss ideas openly with other participants. Each round is a fresh opportunity to try new techniques and refine your approach.

## Coding Rounds

Before each coding round, participants will partner up by choosing somebody they have not previously paired with. Together, you will need to decide on a programming language, and possibly even fork a repo as your starting point. While this can be a great way to experience a new language, I recommend that at least one person within the pair be experienced with the chosen language.

As you will be pair-programming, you should both be working on the same files - meaning only one keyboard will be active. You will need to decide on the _style_ of pair programming you will use for the round. You can learn more about styles of pair programming in the [Pairing and Collaboraiton](./pairing-and-collaboration.md) sections.

When the round starts, you will have 45 minutes to code.

After 45 minutes, pairs will **delete their code**. Yep, that is is not a typo; you will literally delete the code you just wrote. The [README](../README.md) describes an npm script you can run that will reset your forked project to its initial state. Get in the habit of doing that after each round.

> The goal is to _practice_! None of this code will be reviewed, and it will definitely not be deployed to any production environment. As tempting as it is to keep your code, the value of this experience is in the _practice_ - the conversations, the insights, and the learnings you gained along the way - not the code you wrote. Deleting your code not only gives you a clean slate for the next round, but also gives you the freedom to consider new ideas and try different approaches during later rounds.

After deleting code, we spend 15 minutes as a group, where each pair answers the following questions:

- What did you learn?
- What surprised you?
- What would you try differently next time?
