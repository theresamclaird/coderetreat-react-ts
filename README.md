# Coderetreat Starter: React, TypeScript, Jest

A minimal React + TypeScript + Jest starter for coderetreats.

## Getting Started

If you're participating in a coderetreat, **fork this repository** as your personal starting point for a React + TypeScript + Jest project.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 8 or newer
- A modern code editor
- Git

## Reset

During a coderetreat, it’s essential to reset after each round. Remember — the goal is to practice, not to produce code that needs to be reviewed or deployed. Resetting gives you the freedom to experiment, make mistakes and learn from them without consequence. Each new round is a chance to start fresh, try a different approach, and explore new design ideas with a clean slate.

This script will restore your `src/` folder to its clean, starting state. Do this at the end of each round.

```bash
npm run reset:baseline
```
