# Coderetreat React (TypeScript)

A minimal React + TypeScript starter for coderetreats.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

## Reset
```bash
npm run reset:baseline   # restore src/ to the baseline starter
```

or
```bash
npm run reset:git        # hard reset the repo (⚠ destructive)
```

## Documentation

This project includes additional reference material in the [`/docs`](./docs) folder to support coderetreat sessions and TDD practice:

- [Four Rules of Simple Design](./docs/four-rules-of-simple-design.md)  
  Guiding principles for writing clean, maintainable, and expressive code.

- [Test-Driven Development Cycle](./docs/tdd-cycle.md)  
  An overview of the TDD process and how each step shapes design decisions.

- [Conway’s Game of Life](./docs/conways-game-of-life.md)  
  A classic kata for exploring state transitions, refactoring, and emergent design.

> During coderetreats, use these documents as prompts for discussion, reflection, and iteration.

## Other Katas

While the **Game of Life** is a popular choice for coderetreats, you can use this project as a starting point for any problem that encourages incremental design and refactoring. Choose exercises that are small, testable, and open-ended enough to spark discussion about design choices and collaboration.

Here are a few classic examples:

- **FizzBuzz** — A simple introduction to test-driven thinking and refactoring loops and conditions.  
- **String Calculator** — Focuses on incremental test discovery and handling edge cases gracefully.  
- **Roman Numerals** — Encourages thinking about data transformations and algorithmic clarity.  
- **Bowling Game** — A slightly larger kata involving cumulative state and scoring rules.  
- **Prime Factors** — Reinforces small-step problem solving and function composition.  

Each kata presents different opportunities to explore **clean code**, **TDD**, and **pair programming** skills in a safe, time-boxed setting.
